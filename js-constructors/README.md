# Constructors

## Description
Copy the included `constructors.js` to a new project. Add an index.html that includes it. Answer all the questions and upload to __gh-pages__.

Keep in mind in the examples in `constructors.js` I need to be able to test them in __gh-pages__ on the console. Also make sure there are no javascript errors and check your code in [js hint](http://jshint.com/). Finally make sure it is formatted/indented correctly. Code is in place that validates each answer. It will currently say: `Assertion failed` for each question. Once you answer the question correctly that will go away. Use this to check your work.
